# Foreman code review model for Github repos

This repository aims to demonstrate the possibility to perform
post-merge, foreman style code reviews, directly on Github.

In high trust, disciplined software teams, such a method of
working can enable faster cycle times, without sacrificing
quality of the produced software.

If you can maintain decent test suite, then there's little
reason to block deployments with code reviews (unless you're NASA).
